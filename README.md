# Capstone
This repository contains project files associated with my George Washington Univeristy MS in Data Science Captstone. 

My project is on Natural Language Generation (NLG), specifically song lyric generation in the "indie" style of music. My final paper and presentation are located in the **Presentation-Materials** folder.

Most relevant files are in the **Final-Model** and **Dataset-Preprocess** folders. To recreate the results of my project, please start with data preprocessing, and then run the training file in **Final-Model** before running either generation file. To generate songs only, please download the model from google here:

Then you may proceed to run either the mass_generate.py or generate.py file to generate many or a single song, respectively. 

More information on which files to run in  **Final-Model** and **Dataset-Preprocess**  and in which order can be found in the README.md files in each respective folder.
